# intestinal-spheroids-drug-delivery
Algorithm that takes a confocal microscope image of intestinal spheroids grown in a three dimensional matrix and measures the fluorescence intensity (normalized to square micrometer) of a fluorescent drug that has been transported to the lumen (inside) of the spheroids in order to measure drug concentrations over time.

How to get the code to work? 
i) Download the code (spheroid_int_code.ipynb) and the .tif images (sample images.zip)
ii) open code in a jupyterlab notebook
iii) change the "fileFolder" variable in the box with the header "Read all files/ images in folder" to where you saved the unzipped images
iv) you should be able to execute all boxes in the given order now
